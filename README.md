# Red Herring Keyboard

Red Herring is a 75% ortholinear keyboard with staggered columns and a split ergonomic layout similar to an Arisu/Alice.  Here you will find the KiCad 6 files for the PCB and plate, along with Illustrator files for the case and wrist rest. Keyboard features:
- All through-hole components
- Diodes arranged in a unique herringbone pattern
- Large rotary encoder knob (up to 48mm diameter)
- 64x128 OLED display (SSD1107)
- Compatible with most standard keycap sets (1.75u for left shift, and 2u for left space)
- Different [layout options](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/cf2afd92ae2ac742f6cb94146715b537), including ISO

## Firmware ([Vial](https://get.vial.today/)):

If you're flashing a brand new MCU, you will need to use an ISP programmer to install a bootloader first. I didn't have an AVR ISP programmer, so I flashed a spare Elite-C to do this.

Look in the `firmware` folder for hex files and more info on flashing.

## Thanks!
This project would not have been possible without the time and dedication of everyone who worked on the amazing keyboards I learned and took inspiration from.  To name a few: Jabberwocky, Boardrun, Basketweave, Adelheid, Mercutio, Discipline, and Mysterium.
